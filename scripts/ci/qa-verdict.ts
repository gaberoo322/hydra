/**
 * scripts/ci/qa-verdict.ts — Pure helpers for the hydra-qa skill's
 * one-pass verdict classifier (issue #405).
 *
 * Background: before #405, the hydra-qa subagent looped waiting on pending
 * required CI checks (e.g. `mutation-test`) before emitting a verdict. This
 * meant a single QA run could span hours, sometimes long enough that the PR
 * auto-merged in the background. The new behaviour: run the code-review pass
 * once, then return one of four verdicts based on (review verdict + CI
 * state):
 *
 *   PASS              — review passed AND all required checks have concluded successfully
 *   FAIL              — review failed (regardless of CI), OR a required check failed/errored
 *   PASS-pending-CI   — review passed BUT some required checks are still queued/running
 *   FAIL-pending-CI   — reserved tier: review passed but a NON-required pending check would
 *                       likely block merge if it later fails. (Currently behaves like
 *                       PASS-pending-CI for the classifier; documented for the operator playbook
 *                       so autopilot can route accordingly.)
 *
 * The autopilot loop polls CI separately and re-dispatches QA (or merges) once
 * the pending state resolves. The subagent itself never blocks waiting on CI.
 *
 * This module is pure — no fs/network — so it can be unit-tested directly
 * (see test/hydra-qa-prompt-verdict.test.mts).
