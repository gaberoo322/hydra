/**
 * scheduler/research-decision.ts — Pure decision function for "should the
 * scheduler run a research cycle right now?"
 *
 * Extracted from the 200-line `maybeRunResearch()` in scheduler/loop.ts so
 * the policy can be unit-tested independently of Redis, work-queue state,
 * and the research subagent itself. The decision is the part that gets
 * tweaked most often; concentrating it here is the depth payoff.
 *
 * Shape:
 *
 *     loadResearchSnapshot()      [I/O, in loop.ts]
 *     → decideResearchAction()    [pure, in this file]
 *     → executeResearchAction()   [I/O, in loop.ts]
 *
 * `ResearchAction` is a discriminated union. Each variant carries the
 * drivers that produced it so operators reading
 * `/api/scheduler/status.lastResearchDecision` (or the dashboard, or
 * logs) can see *why* without re-deriving from environment values.
 *
 * Guard evaluation order matches the legacy `maybeRunResearch` for
 * behavioural compatibility — operators with existing intuition about
 * the scheduler's mood see the same outcomes.
