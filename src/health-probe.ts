// ServiceProbe Adapter Seam (issue #1980) — extracted from src/api/health.ts.
//
// The plain-HTTP service probe (probeService) and the OpenViking liveness probe
// (probeOv), plus the {status, latencyMs} wire shape they fold to
// (ServiceProbeResult), used to live in the route file src/api/health.ts. Issue
// #1324 first hoisted them from inline closures (duplicated in /health/services
// and the /health/deep fan-out) to module-level; this issue completes the move
// by giving them a focused, named home so "how does the orchestrator classify a
// service as running vs failed?" has a single answer.
//
// This is a thin probe-classification seam, NOT a new boundary Adapter family.
// It composes existing boundaries: probeOv() delegates to the OpenViking Request
// Adapter (ovHealthGet, src/knowledge-base/ov-request.ts, #954) and probeService
// uses globalThis.fetch via an injectable impl. There is no raw child_process or
// raw OpenViking fetch to fence, so — unlike the Host-Probe Adapter
// (src/host-probe/*) — it stays a single file with no seam-check ratchet.
//
// It deliberately lives at src/ top-level (NOT src/api/), mirroring the
// src/health-diagnostics.ts pure Health Assessment seam: the probes are a domain
// seam consumed by route code, and a non-route caller (e.g.
// src/aggregators/service-strip.ts) composing the canonical probes should not
// import from src/api/.

 * downstream depend on. A non-2xx response is `failed` unless `acceptAny` is set
 * (the probe only cares that the port answered). Unified on
 * `AbortSignal.timeout(3000)` (the modern primitive — no manual timer bookkeeping).
 *
 * `fetchImpl` is an injectable dependency (default `globalThis.fetch`) so the
 * test can stub success/non-2xx/throw/timeout without a real network.
