/**
 * Settled-fold contract — a cross-cutting async utility (issues #916, #3216).
 *
 * The contract: fan a set of sub-reads out under `Promise.allSettled`, and on
 * a *rejected* sub-read log it (CLAUDE.md fail-loud) and degrade that slice to
 * a fallback so the composing read itself never throws. A single slow `gh`
 * call can't blank the whole result.
 *
 * This is a *general* async utility — "degrade a `Promise.allSettled` slice to
 * a safe fallback while logging the rejection" — that belongs to no specific
 * domain. It lives at the flat `src/` root (alongside `src/errors.ts`) so any
 * module with a multi-source fan-out can import it without reaching across a
 * group boundary: dashboard aggregators (`src/aggregators/`), the autopilot
 * status composition seam (`src/autopilot/status.ts`), `src/review-pickup.ts`,
 * and any future caller. It was originally namespaced under `src/aggregators/`
 * (#916) because the ten aggregators were its first callers; #3216 relocated
 * it to the root since the fold is not an aggregators-domain concept and
 * migrated every caller to import from here directly (no back-compat shim —
 * the aggregators-namespaced re-export was dead-on-arrival and removed).
 *
 * The originating copy-paste problem (#916): the same fold was independently
 * redeclared as a private `settledOrEmpty<T>` / `settledOr<T>` /
 * `settledOrNull<T>` helper in ten aggregators, each re-deciding the log
 * format and the `Array.isArray` defensiveness. The copies had already
 * drifted — `autopilot-health` added an `Array.isArray` guard the others
 * lacked; some logs carried a `(${label})` suffix, some didn't; one variant
 * swallowed `result.value ?? null`.
 *
 * This module is the single home for that fold. The three observed shapes
 * are the same fold parameterised by fallback:
 *
 *   - {@link settledOrEmpty} — degrade a `T[]` sub-read to `[]`
 *     (with the `Array.isArray` guard that `autopilot-health` had and the
 *     others lacked — defensiveness folded in, not forked out).
 *   - {@link settledOr}      — degrade a `T` sub-read to an arbitrary fallback.
 *   - {@link settledOrNull}  — degrade a `T` sub-read to `null`.
 *
 * All three route through {@link settle}, so the "never throws / always logs"
 * contract has one referent and one test surface
 * (`test/aggregator-settle.test.mts`).
