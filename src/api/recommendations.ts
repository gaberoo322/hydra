// Issue #1322: the operator-action-items surface — extracted out of
// createHealthRouter (src/api/health.ts) into its own deep, named home. This
// router owns the operator-action-items *policy*: which categories exist, their
// priority ordering, and the trigger thresholds. Adding a category or moving a
// threshold now touches exactly this one file.
//
// The public HTTP path stays byte-identical: this router mounts PREFIX-LESS in
// src/api.ts (like createHealthRouter), so Express still registers the literal
// `/recommendations` path → `/api/recommendations`. README documents it as a
// public endpoint; no in-repo or dashboard caller exists (the dashboard moved
// to /api/now/recommendations, #674), but external HTTP clients still rely on
// it, so it is PRESERVED not deleted.
//
// CONTEXT.md L34: this `/recommendations` operator-action-item surface is
// DISTINCT from a Health Diagnostic (the /health/deep ruleset) — they are
// different surfaces, which is why this lives in its own router and NOT in
// health-diagnostics.ts.
