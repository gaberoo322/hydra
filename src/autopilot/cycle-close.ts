/**
 * Autopilot **cycle-close** coordinator — the cross-domain orchestration point
 * for "a code-writing dispatch just finished; stamp the outcome record across
 * the runs (cycle-hash), metrics, and scheduler-counter domains."
 *
 * This Module was split out of `runs.ts` (issue #2768). `runs.ts` retains the
 * narrow **run/turn-lifecycle write** path (`startRun`/`endRun`/`recordTurn`);
 * this sibling owns the wider
 * `recordCycle` coordination, which pulls from three domains at once. It follows
 * the same per-concern sibling-extraction precedent as `run-projections.ts`
 * (read projections, #1183) and `sweep-reader.ts` (dead-pid sweep, #2568): one
 * Module per concern, with a downward import edge into the zero-I/O leaf
 * `run-result.ts` for the shared result-type primitives (issue #3087).
 *
 * Concepts (see `CONTEXT.md`):
 *   - **Cycle record** — the per-dispatch outcome hash `hydra:cycle:<id>` plus
 *     its ZSET index membership, the metrics-hash feed, and the lifetime
 *     scheduler counters. `recordCycle` is its SOLE writer (ADR-0016/ADR-0012):
 *     it must NOT set `hydra:cycle:active`, the `:agents`/`:costs` sub-keys, or
 *     any `hydra:task:*` / `hydra:deps:*` keys.
 *
 * Errors are returned as result objects, never thrown, matching the
 * `merge/grounding/verification` convention in CLAUDE.md — the shared
 * `Ok`/`Err` result types and the `errRedis`/`numberOrDefault` helpers live in
 * the zero-I/O leaf `run-result.ts` (their single source of truth, shared with
 * the run/turn writers and the read orchestrators; issue #3087) and are imported
 * here. (The `ErrorCode` union that `Err` is built from stays module-internal to
 * that leaf — it has no external importer.)
