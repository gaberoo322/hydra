# Issue tracker conventions

Issues are tracked in GitHub Issues on `gaberoo322/hydra` via the `gh` CLI. Subagents (`hydra-dev`, `hydra-target-build`, `hydra-qa`) read and write issues directly — there is no in-repo issue store.

## Issue lifecycle

```
needs-triage  →  needs-info       (asked for more detail; back to operator)
              →  ready-for-agent  (fully specified; subagent may pick up)
              →  in-progress      (claimed by a subagent)
              →  needs-qa         (PR open, awaiting QA)
              →  blocked          (depends on another open issue)
              →  ready-for-human  (subagent gave up; operator decision)
              →  wontfix          (closed without implementation)
              →  target-backlog   (about ~/hydra-betting, queued to target board)
```

See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` for the canonical label semantics.

## Scope contract (issue #396)

Every issue labelled `ready-for-agent` MUST include a `## Files in scope` section, and SHOULD include a `## Files out of scope` section. This is the subagent-side replacement for the deleted in-cycle `reconcilePlanVsActual()` step.

### Why

After PR #400 (issue #383) deleted the in-process planner and the deterministic plan-vs-actual diff that ran in `src/control-loop.ts:reconcilePlanVsActual()`, the only thing standing between a subagent and arbitrary file edits was `hydra-qa`'s eyeball review. The scope-creep auto-promoted planner rule had 231 hits before the deletion — it was the single most-recorded failure mode. Pushing the scope contract into the issue body re-establishes the gate at the entry point that the subagents actually consult.

### What the sections do

| Section | Effect |
|---|---|
| `## Files in scope` | Soft boundary. Files matching the listed entries (backticked code spans or bullet text; prefix match, so `src/foo/` covers everything beneath) are fair game. Files outside this list count toward the ratio-based scope gate (`>80% out-of-scope` blocks merge). |
| `## Files out of scope` | Hard boundary. ANY changed file matching this list fails CI's `scope-check` job regardless of ratio — unless explicitly justified (see below). |
| `scope-justification:` block in the PR body | Per-file escape hatch. Whitelists a specific out-of-scope file with a one-line rationale. Loud (logged in the CI step summary) but allowed. |

### Example

```markdown
## Files in scope

- `scripts/ci/scope-check.ts`
- `test/ci-scope-check.test.mts`
- `docs/operator-playbooks/hydra-dev.md`

## Files out of scope

- `src/control-loop.ts`
- `src/preflight.ts`
```

And in the resulting PR body, if the subagent had to touch a shared fixture:

```markdown
scope-justification: `test/helpers/fixtures.ts` — shared test fixture required by the new test
```

### Enforcement

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-or-bug.yml` — GitHub form template surfaced at issue-creation time. Prefills `Problem Statement`, `Evidence`, `Files in scope`, and `Files out of scope` so structurally-correct issues are the default rather than a convention triage has to remember. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` controls whether blank issues stay available alongside the form.
- `.github/workflows/issue-label-validation.yml` — runs on three triggers:
  - `issues: labeled` — when `ready-for-agent` is applied, blocks the transition if `## Files in scope` is missing (moves the label to `needs-info` and comments).
  - `issues: edited` — when a `ready-for-agent` issue's body is edited, re-validates so removing the scope section after the label is applied still demotes the issue (issue #505).
  - `schedule: nightly cron` — audits every open `ready-for-agent` issue and demotes any that drift out of compliance. Catches grandfathered issues that pre-date the workflow + race-condition bypasses of the per-event triggers (issue #505).

  Operator override is unchanged: "fix the body and re-apply the label".
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `scope-check` job — parses both sections from the PR body and the linked issue body; fails the PR if drift is detected. See `docs/quality-gates.md`.
- Subagent playbooks (`docs/operator-playbooks/hydra-dev.md`, `hydra-target-build.md`) embed a scope-respect block in the child prompt so the subagent reads the contract before writing code.

## Standard fetch / edit commands

```bash
# Fetch an issue including body + labels
gh issue view <N> --repo gaberoo322/hydra --json number,title,body,labels,state

# List ready-for-agent issues
gh issue list --repo gaberoo322/hydra --label ready-for-agent --state open

# Transition labels
gh issue edit <N> --repo gaberoo322/hydra --remove-label ready-for-agent --add-label in-progress
gh issue edit <N> --repo gaberoo322/hydra --remove-label in-progress --add-label needs-qa

# Close with a reason
gh issue close <N> --repo gaberoo322/hydra --comment "Resolved by #<PR>" --reason completed
```

## Wayfinding operations

How `/wayfinder` (and `/hydra-wayfinder`) expresses its shared map on this tracker.

| Concept | Expression |
|---|---|
| Map | Issue labelled `wayfinder:map` |
| Ticket | **Native sub-issue** of the map, labelled `wayfinder:<type>` — one of `research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, `task` |
| Claim | Native assignee (`gh issue edit <N> --add-assignee @me`); open + unassigned = unclaimed |
| Blocking | Native blocked-by relationship (renders visually in GitHub's issue UI) |
| Frontier | Open, unassigned sub-issues of the map whose blockers are all closed |

Wayfinder tickets stay **off-radar**: never apply the `needs-triage`/`ready-for-agent` lifecycle labels to them, so `hydra-sweep` and the orphan-backstop stay blind (the `wayfinder:*` labels carry zero lifecycle meaning). This rule is **refined, not removed**, by the autopilot integration below: the AFK share of a map becomes dispatchable through a **dedicated map-frontier signal**, never by relabeling to `ready-for-agent` (ADR-0029 Decision 3).

### Autopilot integration (AFK dispatch)

`hydra-autopilot` charts and works the AFK share of a map without unwinding the off-radar rule (ADR-0029):

- **Frontier dispatch path.** `collect-state.sh` runs the native GraphQL frontier query per open, approved (no `wayfinder:destination-pending`) map and pre-resolves the next AFK-typed (`wayfinder:research` / `wayfinder:task`), unblocked, unclaimed frontier ticket into `state.json` as a signal. `decide.py` (pure — enumerates nothing, calls no network) reads that signal and emits a `dispatch` action for the **`wayfinder_orch`** signal class, which routes by ticket type (`wayfinder:research` → `/hydra-issue-research`; `wayfinder:task` → a scoped task worker). HITL-typed tickets (`wayfinder:grilling` / `wayfinder:prototype`) are never dispatched — `wayfinder_orch` skips them and works the AFK ones not blocked by them.
- **Two `hydra-review` buckets** are the single operator morning drain: (1) **destination-pending maps** — machine-charted maps awaiting a Destination approve/amend/reject (approve = remove the `wayfinder:destination-pending` label); and (2) **wayfinder HITL tickets** — open maps' unblocked, unclaimed `grilling` / `prototype` tickets awaiting a live `/wayfinder <map> <ticket>` session. There is no autopilot-side answer ingestion; the interactive session records the resolution, closes the ticket, and appends to the map, and the next tick resumes AFK dispatch.
- **Native-map / body-text-epic boundary.** Map internals (charting wiring, the `collect-state.sh` frontier collector, AFK gating) use **native** sub-issues + blocked-by — the frontier query above reads them. The `hydra-prd` **handoff epic** the map produces uses **body-text** `## Sub-issues` + `Blocked by #N`, which `hydra-dev`, `hydra-epic-close`, and #3059's `deriveBoardState` filter parse. The two conventions never collide and must not be collapsed into one (ADR-0029 Decision 5).

### Commands

Sub-issue and blocked-by mutations are GraphQL-only; fetch node IDs via REST to spare the GraphQL rate budget:

```bash
MAP_ID=$(gh api repos/gaberoo322/hydra/issues/<MAP_N> --jq .node_id)

# Link a ticket as a sub-issue of the map (create-then-wire second pass)
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($map:ID!,$ticket:ID!){
  addSubIssue(input:{issueId:$map, subIssueId:$ticket}){ issue { number } } }' \
  -f map="$MAP_ID" -f ticket="$TICKET_ID"

# Mark ticket B blocked by ticket A
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($blocked:ID!,$blocker:ID!){
  addBlockedBy(input:{issueId:$blocked, blockingIssueId:$blocker}){ issue { number } } }' \
  -f blocked="$B_ID" -f blocker="$A_ID"

# Frontier: open, unblocked, unclaimed children of map <MAP_N>
gh api graphql -F n=<MAP_N> -f query='query($n:Int!){
  repository(owner:"gaberoo322", name:"hydra"){ issue(number:$n){
    subIssues(first:100){ nodes { number title state
      assignees(first:1){totalCount}
      blockedBy(first:20){nodes{ number state }} } } } } }' \
  --jq '.data.repository.issue.subIssues.nodes
        | map(select(.state=="OPEN" and .assignees.totalCount==0
          and ([.blockedBy.nodes[]? | select(.state=="OPEN")] | length)==0))
        | .[] | "#\(.number) \(.title)"'
```
